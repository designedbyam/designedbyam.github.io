      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up as an athlete instilled in me the grit and grace needed to navigate life’s challenges. My journey took a pivotal turn during a championship race in China back in 2019, where I initially aimed to complete the grueling 21km course on a ski mountain in three and a half hours. With an elevation gain of 1,800 meters (5,413 feet) and 33 obstacles, I quickly realized that my ambitious goal was unrealistic.

        As I approached the finish line, I pulled the Philippine flag from my pack and raised it high with pride. The clock read 07:43:50 — far from my original goal, but in that moment, I felt a deep sense of accomplishment. I was proud to represent my country; win or lose.

        I had already packed my gear and was getting ready to leave the race grounds when I suddenly heard them announce my name. Finishing second place was a huge surprise, and I couldn’t be more proud to have raised the Philippine flag as I got up on the podium. This experience taught me the importance of discipline, consistency, and resilience. Qualities that have shaped every aspect of my life, from athletics to academics to my professional career.
